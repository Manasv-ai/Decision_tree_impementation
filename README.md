🩺 Diabetes Dataset – Machine Learning Project

📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting diabetes progression using the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.
The goal is to apply different machine learning models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate model performance using regression metrics.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook


🚀 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Preprocessing

Loaded Diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Converted features into a Pandas DataFrame with columns:
['age','sex','bmi','bp','s1','s2','s3','s4','s5','s6'].

Explored the dataset with summary statistics and visualizations (heatmaps, pairplots).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation heatmap to study relationships between features.

Distribution plots for key variables.


Model Training

Implemented Decision Tree Regressor as baseline.

Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

Compared models with different parameter settings.


Model Evaluation

Metrics used: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score.

Observed how depth, splitter strategy, and feature selection affected performance.


📊 Results

Identified BMI, Blood Pressure, and Serum measurements as strong predictors.

DecisionTreeRegressor tuned with GridSearchCV improved performance significantly.

Key insight: Proper parameter tuning (like max_depth, criterion, splitter) helps balance bias-variance tradeoff.
